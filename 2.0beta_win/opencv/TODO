Optimization:
    Support for IPP (ippcv, ippi, ippvm ...), MKL/atlas

SFM and 3D:
    Higher-level Optical Flow:
        (verification via epipolar geometry reconstruction
         and backprojection error measurement - ransac etc.)
    Tri-focal tensor

Comp. Geometry:
    - Min-eps contour approximation (fixed number of sites)
    - Graphs from point sets (NNG, MST, RNG ...)
    - CvSubdiv2D -> CvGraph conversion
    - More contour comparison functions (e.g. Housedorph distance)
    - Primitive geometric operations (test pt-contour,
              contour-contour intersection, union etc.)

Misc. Functionality:
    - Smarter image segmentation methods (?)
    - Textures handling to main library (better specs, methods?)

Documentation:
    Document HaarFaceDetect

Apps:
    Rewrite demos in FLTK(?) to make them cross-platform

Interfaces:
    C++ interface (STL-like interface to CvMat
       (see cvaux/include/cvmat.hpp as a starting point), CvSeq,CvGraph)
    Java etc. interfaces using SWIG

Cameras:
    Make a single camera module instead of 3. That is what we have now:

       Module      Interface                Win32                    Linux

       cvcam       C (callbacks)      DirectShow (AVI/Cam)         V4L[2] (Cam)
       highgui     C (no callbacks)   VFW (AVI/Cam), MIL (Cam)     ffmpeg (AVI)
       camera.cpp     C++                  VFW (Cam)                   -

    The proposed variant:
       highgui like interface (i.e. no callbacks),
       extended with some cvcam features like customization dialogs,
       resolution changes, camera selection etc.),

       Win32: DirectShow, VFW, MIL
       Linux: FFMPEG + V4L2

Others:
    Throw out or improve old stuff (dense opt. flow, 2d hmm,
                                   eigen objects (simplify interface))

    Better test system with regression tests (improve trs(?))
    Performance (speed) tests
    Complete Mac OS X port
